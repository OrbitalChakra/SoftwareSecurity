# SoftwareSecurity
SNHU CS305 Project

The client wanted an application with security features meant for the financial industry within an international domain. Their name was Artemis Financial. When I ran static tests, I found issues with their versioning and recommended updating the versions of their dependencies. I found it challenging working with the project management tool Maven, but learned how to create web applications and APIs using that tool. By reviewing the code for best practices I was able to find issues with functionality that developers left. In the future, I recommend the dependencies be discussed through the SDLC to understand new releases.Â
